# Terraform Workshop
Terraform is a powerful multi-cloud "infrastructure as Code" tool that helps you provision and manage resources effectively anywhere. In this workshop, we'll introduce basic AWS concepts and write Terraform code to incrementally create AWS resources. Finally we'll deploy a simple application to the cloud and tear everything down at the end.

## Prerequisites
- An AWS account (if you don't already have one, sign up for free credits at https://aws.amazon.com/free/)
- AWS CLI installed (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)
- AWS credentials created (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys)
- AWS credentials configured (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-where) 
- Terraform CLI installed (https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

## Note
Running this workshop will not incur much, if any, cost on AWS.
